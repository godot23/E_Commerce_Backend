# E-Commerce-Backend

### Description
This program allows users to check, input, change, and delete items in an e-commerce enabled database.

### Usage
Users can use any front-end program that is capable of issuing get, post, put, and delete commands to a server. Using this, they can enter entries into the database using JSON notation, or retrieve or delete items in the database by hitting appropriate endpoints.
